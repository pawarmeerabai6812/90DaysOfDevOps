# Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud

## Introduction
I am a working professional from a IT background transitioning into DevOps and Cloud Engineering.
I am starting this journey with a genuine interest in infrastructure, cloud systems, and how modern applications are built, deployed, and operated in real-world environments.

This 90-day plan is my execution blueprint to move from fundamentals to job-ready DevOps skills through consistent daily practice.

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is not just a set of tools.
It is a culture and practice that focuses on collaboration between development and operations, automation of workflows, reliability of systems, and faster delivery of value to users.

Cloud computing provides on-demand infrastructure, scalability, and managed services that enable DevOps practices to work efficiently at scale.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
* To stay current with evolving tools and best practices in the DevOps ecosystem
* To build production-grade expertise that delivers measurable business value
* To transition from operational tasks to strategic infrastructure design and optimization
* To strengthen my ability to architect cloud-native solutions at scale

## Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Goals)

- Deploy a production-grade microservices application on Kubernetes with auto-scaling, monitoring, and GitOps-based deployments
- Build and maintain a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/GitLab CI with security scanning, testing, and blue-green deployments
- Achieve proficiency in Infrastructure as Code by managing multi-environment cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible.

## Core DevOps Skills to Build

1. Advanced Kubernetes Management - Pod troubleshooting, networking, security policies, Helm charts, and cluster optimization
2. CI/CD Pipeline Mastery - Building robust pipelines with automated testing, security gates, artifact management, and deployment strategies
3. Observability & Incident Response - Setting up comprehensive monitoring, logging, alerting with Prometheus/Grafana/ELK, and conducting RCA

## Weekly Time Budget
- Weekdays (Mon-Fri): 2-2.5 hours daily (hands-on labs, documentation, learning)
- Weekends (Sat-Sun): 4-5 hours per day (projects, debugging, writing blog posts)
- Total weekly commitment: 18-20 hours.

## Consistency Strategy
Daily standup with myself: 10-minute review each morning of what I'll learn today
Public accountability: Share progress on LinkedIn/GitHub weekly
Hands-on first: Build, break, fix - no passive watching without implementation
Document everything: Maintain daily notes in a GitHub repo to track learnings and blockers
No zero days: Even 30 minutes counts; consistency beats intensity
Weekend projects: Apply weekly learnings to real-world scenarios every Saturday/Sunday


Happy Learning
